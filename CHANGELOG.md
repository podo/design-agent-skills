Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **CLI: `doctor` command** — checks trigger phrase collisions across the full catalogue, reports broken symlinks in installed skills, and flags categories with no rank-1 entry. Exits 1 if issues found.
- **CLI: `--json` flag on `--list`** — outputs categories + counts as a JSON array for scripting. `npx design-agent-skills --list --json`.
- **CLI: experimental-tier warning** — when a filtered install set includes experimental-tier skills, a `⚠` warning is shown before installing.
- **CI: `test.yml` — Validate README skills table step** — `generate-readme-table.mjs --check` runs on every PR; fails if the README Skills section drifts from stub data.
- **CI: `upstream-check.yml` — rank-1 gap report** — weekly run now also reports categories with no rank-1 skill (warning only, does not fail).
- **Branch protection** — `main` now requires the `validate` CI check to pass before merging.
- **`npm version` hooks** — `preversion` runs `npm test`; `version` atomically writes `VERSION` and stages it. Running `npm version <X>` now handles both files safely.

### Fixed

- **`doctor` command** — was documented in README but not implemented; now works.
- **`content-design` category — 0 skills** — `ux-writing-skill` was miscategorized as `visual-components`; fixed to `content-design`. `product-position` (B2B messaging/positioning) also moved from `product-pm` to `content-design`. Category now has 2 skills.
- **6 categories with no rank-1 skill** — promoted one best-in-class skill per category: `remotion` (creative-3d), `emilkowalski-skill` (design-engineering), `email-html-mjml` (email-design), `interaction-design` (interaction-polish), `anthropics-skills` (official-suites), `textual-tui-skill` (tui-terminal).
- **CLAUDE.md worked example** — `stub.yaml` in the worked example now includes `category: tui-terminal`.
- **Undocumented stub.yaml fields** — `install_default`, `installed_as`, `note`, `install_claude`, `install_npm` are now documented in CLAUDE.md and allowed-listed in `stub.yaml field validation` test.

### Changed

- **`readStubs()`** — removed SKILL.md fallback for category (dead code after Q2 migration); now reads category directly from stub.yaml. Added `tier` field to returned stub objects.
- **`test/stubs.test.js`** — added `stub.yaml field validation` suite (142 tests); unknown fields now fail CI immediately.
- **`test/cli.test.js`** — 28 → 40 tests; added source-pattern coverage for `--json` and `doctor`, and integration tests for `--essentials`, `--all`, `--category` + `--dry-run`, `--list --json`, and `doctor`.
- **README Skills section** — regenerated from `scripts/generate-readme-table.mjs`; now stays in sync via CI check.
- **CLAUDE.md** — test count updated to 2401; stub.yaml fields section complete.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **CLI: `--help` / `-h` flag** — prints usage, all flags, examples, and valid categories. Running `npx design-agent-skills --help` now works correctly.
- **CLI: `--list` command** — shows all categories with per-category skill counts. `npx design-agent-skills --list` or `npx design-agent-skills list`.
- **CLI: `--dry-run` flag** — previews what would be installed (any profile/category) without making changes. Composable: `--picks --dry-run`, `--category figma-code --dry-run`.
- **CI: `test.yml` workflow** — PR gate on every push/PR to main. Runs the full test suite and validates that the README skill count matches the actual catalogue.
- **CI: `upstream-check.yml` workflow** — weekly scheduled check (Monday 09:00 UTC) that fetches all `type:skill` upstream URLs via GitHub API and fails on 404/451. Runnable manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
- **Dependabot** — weekly GitHub Actions version updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- **PR template** — `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with add-a-skill and bug-fix checklists.
- **`scripts/sync-categories.mjs`** — one-time migration: writes `category:` from SKILL.md `das:` block into each `stub.yaml`. Run with `--dry-run` to preview.
- **`scripts/rank-audit.mjs`** — shows rank distribution (R1/R2/R3) by category; flags categories with no rank-1 entry.
- **`scripts/generate-readme-table.mjs`** — generates the `## Skills` section of README from stub data. Run with `--check` to diff against current README.
- **19 VALID_CATEGORIES** — added `motion-animation`, `design-engineering`, `design-research` to both `bin/cli.mjs` and `test/stubs.test.js`.

### Fixed

- **README skill count** — corrected from 142 to 136 (routers are not user-facing skills and were incorrectly included).
- **`isInstall` detection** — flags passed as first arg (`--picks`, `--category`) no longer fall through to `npx skills` delegation; correctly treated as install commands.
- **Publish gate: VERSION sync check** — `publish.yml` now verifies `VERSION` matches `package.json` before `npm publish`.
- **CLAUDE.md** — updated test count (1580 → 2252), category table (16 → 19 entries), and removed hardcoded count from test file description.
- **Stub category migration** — all 136 non-router `stub.yaml` files now carry an explicit `category:` field (was read-only from SKILL.md).

### Changed

- **`test.yml`** — replaced the inline duplicate-trigger script (covered by `npm test`) with a README count validation step.
- **`test/cli.test.js`** — expanded from 17 to 28 tests: source-pattern coverage for all new flags + 6 integration tests that spawn the real CLI binary.

## [2.1.2] — 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Category TUI** — all categories showed 0 skills and installs returned "No skills match". Root cause: `readStubs()` read `category` from `stub.yaml`, but all 142 stubs store category in `SKILL.md` frontmatter under `das.category`. CLI now falls back to SKILL.md when `stub.yaml` has no `category` field.
- **CI** — npm OIDC Trusted Publishing failed with misleading E404 because Node 20 ships npm v10, which doesn't implement the OIDC handshake. Switched to Node 24 (npm v11).

---

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **All stubs** — stub decision trees now tell the agent to surface `! npx skills add …` as a chat message when auto-install is blocked (Claude Code auto-mode). Includes scope guidance: add `-g` for global install or omit for project-only. Pattern A stubs (scope-detection format) already handled scope correctly; this fixes B/C/D patterns.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **`bin/cli.mjs`** — replaced numbered text prompts with a clack-style arrow-key TUI. `◇`/`◆`/`●`/`○` symbols, `↑↓` navigation, `ENTER` to confirm, `Q`/`Ctrl-C` to quit. Category sub-prompt shows per-category skill counts. Install output uses `✓`/`✗` per skill with elapsed time. Zero new dependencies — pure Node.js raw mode + ANSI escape codes.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Install profiles** — `--picks` (18 skills), `--essentials` (~77 skills), `--all` (142, default). Interactive prompt when no flag is given.
- **Category filter** — `--category <name>` installs all skills in a specific domain; composable with any profile (`--picks --category accessibility`)
- **`rank` field in stub.yaml** — required on all non-router stubs: `1` = Picks, `2` = Essentials, `3` = Extended. Enforced by test suite.
- **`★` markers in README** — 18 Picks-tier skills marked in the skills table.
- **`.npmignore`** — excludes `test/`, `docs/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` from the published package.

### Changed

- **`bin/cli.mjs`** — fully rewritten: profile selection prompt, `--picks` / `--essentials` / `--all` / `--category` flags, per-skill install loop for filtered installs, batch install preserved for `--all`.
- **`test/stubs.test.js`** — added `rank` validation: non-router stubs must have `rank` of `1`, `2`, or `3` (1674 → 1958 tests).
- **`.gitignore`** — added `docs/plans/` and `node_modules/`.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — documented `rank` field, rank assignment criteria, `--category` flag; updated checklist and common mistakes.

### Breaking

- All non-router `stub.yaml` files now require a `rank` field. Any fork that adds stubs without `rank` will fail `npm test`.

---

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **bin entry** — renamed `bin/cli.js` → `bin/cli.mjs` so npm publish retains the bin entry in ESM packages (was silently stripped under `"type": "module"`)

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **ESM conversion** — converted `bin/cli.js` from CommonJS `require()` to ESM `import` to match `"type": "module"` package setting

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Test suite** — 1510 tests across 6 suites using `node:test` (zero dependencies):
  - `test/stubs.test.js` — file presence, stub.yaml validity (type, tier), SKILL.md frontmatter (name, description, triggers), type:skill upgrade commands use `skills add` not curl, catalogue-level invariants (6 routers, no duplicate triggers)
  - `test/cli.test.js` — bin/cli.js exists, is executable, references correct package and delegates to skills CLI
- **`npm test`** script added to package.json
- **`"type": "module"`** — package is now ESM
- **Engine bumped** to `>=18` (required for `node:test`)

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **Primary install path** — `npx skills add podo/design-agent-skills [-g]` replaces custom install.sh. Integrates with the [skills CLI ecosystem](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) and its 33+ supported agents.
- **Two-tier model (Option C)** — catalogue now has explicit tiers:
  - **Tier 1 — Routing layer** (6 domain catalogues): `type: router` in stub.yaml; permanently owned by this repo; `skills update` always reaches them.
  - **Tier 2 — Implementation pointers** (122 skills): upgrade on first use via `skills add owner/repo --skill <name> [-g]`; ownership transfers to upstream post-upgrade.
- **Upgrade path for type:skill pointers** — all 47 `type: skill` SKILL.md files rewritten: curl commands replaced with `skills add owner/repo --skill <name>` + scope detection (checks `~/.agents/skills/<name>` vs `.agents/skills/<name>` to select `-g` flag).
- **Canonical install path** — full skills now land at `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` (global) or `.agents/skills/<name>/` (project) — the standard `skills` CLI canonical location. Previous `~/.design-agent-skills/` path retired.
- **bin/cli.js** — rewritten as thin wrapper around `npx skills add podo/design-agent-skills`; scope TUI passes `-g` flag; `update`/`remove`/`list` delegated to `skills` CLI directly.
- **README** — install section, commands, how it works, pointer types table, supply chain all updated to reflect new architecture.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **npm package** — `npx design-agent-skills` now works as the primary install path. On first run: clones to `~/.design-agent-skills`. On subsequent runs: pulls latest, then installs.
- **5 domain catalogue routers** — `motion-catalogue`, `figma-catalogue`, `accessibility-catalogue`, `design-engineering-catalogue`, `content-catalogue`. Route by domain before reaching implementation skills.
- **`remove` command** — `install.sh remove <skill>` unlinks a specific skill from all detected agents. `remove --all` unlinks everything.
- **`doctor` command** — detects exact trigger collisions, substring overlaps (`--substr`), orphaned symlinks, and relocated installs.
- **`update --dry-run` / `--frozen`** — preview changes without applying; warn on upstream drift vs lockfile.
- **`lock` command** — generates `design-agent-skills.lock` (SHA256 of every installed skill).
- **Tier classification** — all 128 skills classified as `official` (28), `community` (35), or `experimental` (60). Experimental excluded by default; opt in with `--include-experimental`.
- **`--scope=project`** — link skills to project-level `.claude/skills/` instead of `~`. Warns when user-scope-only agents (codex, droid) are detected but skipped.
- **`installed_as` field** — multi-skill packages (expo-skills: 15 skills, software-mansion-skills: 5 skills, and others) now declare the exact skill names they install, enabling partial-install detection.
- **Symlink fragility detection** — `doctor` reports `BROKEN` (target missing) and `RELOCATED` (target outside current install dir) with recovery instructions.

### Fixed

- `"frontend design"` trigger on `anthropics-skills` renamed to `"Anthropic frontend design"` — previously bled into `microsoft-skills` `"frontend design review"`.
- `"flow field"` trigger on `algorithmic-art` renamed to `"flow field art"` — previously bled into `p5js-hermes` `"flow field p5"`.
- 10 exact trigger collisions across the catalogue resolved.

### Changed

- README rewritten: stubs framing replaced with skill pointer language; domain catalogues documented; trigger routing and overlap map added; supply chain position documented.

## Decision tree

Run this before any chart, diagram, or infographic work:

1. **Is the package already installed?**
   Check: `~/.design-agent-skills/skills/vega/SKILL.md` exists (representative skill).
   - Yes → invoke the relevant skill by name and proceed
   - No → go to step 2

2. **Do you have shell access?**
   - Yes → run the install command below, then invoke the skill
   - No → show the user the install command, ask them to run it, then proceed once confirmed

## Install command

```bash
npx skills add markdown-viewer/skills
```

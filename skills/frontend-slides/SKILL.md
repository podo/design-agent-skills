# frontend-slides

> Catalogue stub — full skill: [zarazhangrui/frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides)

## Decision tree

1. **Is the full skill already installed?**
   Check whether the skill at this location still has a `das:` block:
   - Global: `grep -q "^das:" ~/.agents/skills/frontend-slides/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - Project: `grep -q "^das:" .agents/skills/frontend-slides/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - No `das:` block → full skill installed, invoke it and proceed
   - `das:` block present → go to step 2

2. **Detect scope, then install:**

   To detect scope:
   ```bash
   [ -e ~/.agents/skills/frontend-slides ] && echo "global" || echo "project"
   ```

   **Global** (installed with `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add zarazhangrui/frontend-slides --skill frontend-slides -g -y
   ```

   **Project** (installed without `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add zarazhangrui/frontend-slides --skill frontend-slides -y
   ```
   > **Claude Code:** prefix either command with `!` to run directly in the prompt.

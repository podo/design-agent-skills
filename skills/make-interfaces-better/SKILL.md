  Design engineering principles for making interfaces feel polished and alive.
  Covers micro-interactions, typography details, visual refinement, and the small
  decisions that separate "it works" from "it feels right". By Jakub Krehel
  (Interfere, Interfaces magazine, oklch.fyi).

# make-interfaces-better

> Catalogue stub — full skill: [jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better](https://github.com/jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better)

## Decision tree

1. **Is the full skill already installed?**
   Check whether the skill at this location still has a `das:` block:
   - Global: `grep -q "^das:" ~/.agents/skills/make-interfaces-better/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - Project: `grep -q "^das:" .agents/skills/make-interfaces-better/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - No `das:` block → full skill installed, invoke it and proceed
   - `das:` block present → go to step 2

2. **Detect scope, then install:**

   To detect scope:
   ```bash
   [ -e ~/.agents/skills/make-interfaces-better ] && echo "global" || echo "project"
   ```

   **Global** (installed with `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better --skill make-interfaces-better -g -y
   ```

   **Project** (installed without `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better --skill make-interfaces-better -y
   ```
   > **Claude Code:** prefix either command with `!` to run directly in the prompt.


## Invoke after install

- Skill name: `make-interfaces-better`
- Trigger phrases: "make interfaces better", "interface polish", "micro-interactions", "polished UI"

## What it does

Applies Jakub Krehel's design engineering principles to make interfaces feel genuinely polished — not just functional. Covers micro-interactions, precise typography choices, visual hierarchy refinement, motion timing, and the subtle details (hover states, transitions, spacing rhythm) that distinguish well-crafted UI from generic output. By the creator of oklch.fyi and the Interfaces publication.

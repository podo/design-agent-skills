## Decision tree

Run this for any Google Stitch design workflow:

1. **Is a Stitch skill already installed?**
   Check: `~/.design-agent-skills/skills/stitch-loop/SKILL.md` exists (representative skill).
   - Yes → invoke the specific skill by name and proceed
   - No → go to step 2

2. **Do you have shell access?**
   - Yes → install the specific skill below, then invoke it
   - No → show the user the install command, ask them to run it, then proceed once confirmed

## Install command

```bash
# Create and manage DESIGN.md files
npx skills add google-labs-code/design-md

# Improve prompts with UI/UX vocabulary
npx skills add google-labs-code/enhance-prompt

# Extract Stitch design specs into DESIGN.md format
npx skills add google-labs-code/extract-design-md

# Convert Stitch to React components
npx skills add google-labs-code/react-components

# Build components with shadcn/ui
npx skills add google-labs-code/shadcn-ui

# Iterative design-to-code feedback loop
npx skills add google-labs-code/stitch-loop
```

## Invoke after install

- `design-md` — "DESIGN.md", "create design spec"
- `enhance-prompt` — "enhance my prompt", "improve UI prompt"
- `extract-design-md` — "extract design md", "Stitch to DESIGN.md"
- `react-components` — "Stitch to React", "convert to React"
- `shadcn-ui` — "Stitch to shadcn", "build with shadcn"
- `stitch-loop` — "stitch loop", "iterate design"

## What it does

Google Labs' official Stitch skill collection for the complete design-to-code pipeline. Manages DESIGN.md specification files, enhances prompts with UI/UX vocabulary, converts Stitch output to React components or shadcn/ui, extracts design specs, and runs iterative improvement loops.

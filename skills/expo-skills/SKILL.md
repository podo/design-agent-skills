## What it does

The official Expo skill suite authored by the Expo team, fine-tuned for Opus models. Covers working within the Expo managed and bare workflows, the full Expo SDK API surface, Expo Router (file-based navigation), EAS Build (cloud build service for iOS and Android), and EAS Submit (automated app store submission). The authoritative source for Expo-specific patterns and APIs.

## When NOT to use

- Bare React Native without Expo — use `callstack-agent-skills` or `software-mansion-skills`
- Animation and gesture-heavy work in an Expo project — combine with `software-mansion-skills`
- Mobile UI design work — use `mobile-app-design` or `mobile-app-ui-design`

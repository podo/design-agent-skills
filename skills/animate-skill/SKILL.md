# animate-skill

> Catalogue stub — full skill: [delphi-ai/animate-skill](https://github.com/delphi-ai/animate-skill)

## Decision tree

1. **Is the full skill already installed?**
   Check whether the skill at this location still has a `das:` block:
   - Global: `grep -q "^das:" ~/.agents/skills/animate-skill/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - Project: `grep -q "^das:" .agents/skills/animate-skill/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - No `das:` block → full skill installed, invoke it and proceed
   - `das:` block present → go to step 2

2. **Detect scope, then install:**

   To detect scope:
   ```bash
   [ -e ~/.agents/skills/animate-skill ] && echo "global" || echo "project"
   ```

   **Global** (installed with `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add delphi-ai/animate-skill --skill animate-skill -g -y
   ```

   **Project** (installed without `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add delphi-ai/animate-skill --skill animate-skill -y
   ```

## Invoke after install

- Skill name: `animate-skill`
- Trigger phrases: "animate", "hover animation", "toast animation", "text reveal", "animate-skill"

## What it does

Emil Kowalski-inspired animation patterns for Next.js and React. Ships 8 production-ready working examples: hover micro-interactions, toast notification entrance/exit animations, character and word text reveals, and modal transitions. Design philosophy centres on motion that feels inevitable and purposeful rather than decorative — every animation should serve a clear communicative function. Patterns use CSS transitions and spring physics favoured by the animations.dev aesthetic.

## When NOT to use

- Complex timeline orchestration with multiple sequenced steps (use `gsap-skills`)
- Video or Lottie output (use `wiggle-claude-skill`)

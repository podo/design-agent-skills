## What it does

The official Software Mansion skill suite for React Native production development. Covers the full breadth of their open-source libraries: Reanimated animations, Gesture Handler, React Native SVG, charts and illustrations, on-device AI inference, rich text editing, background thread multithreading, audio processing, and JSI (JavaScript Interface) native modules. Fine-tuned for Opus 4.6+ by the library authors themselves.

## When NOT to use

- Non-React Native projects (web, native iOS/Android without RN)
- Expo-managed workflow projects — use `expo-skills`
- General React Native best practices without animation/gesture focus — use `callstack-agent-skills`

## What it does

Applies Animate.css v4.1.1 animations across HTML, React/JSX components, and WordPress PHP templates. Covers the full Animate.css class catalogue (attention seekers, bouncing, fading, flipping, rotating, sliding, zooming, specials) with correct CDN or npm setup. Adds scroll-triggered reveals using the Intersection Observer API, RTL-aware directional flipping for right-to-left layouts, and `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance to respect user accessibility preferences.

## When NOT to use

- Custom keyframe animations built from scratch (use `css-animation-skill`)
- Interactive gesture-driven animations requiring JavaScript state (use `framer-motion-skills`)

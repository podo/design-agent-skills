# marp-slide-quality

> Catalogue stub — full skill: [nibzard/marp-slide-quality](https://github.com/nibzard/marp-slide-quality)

## Decision tree

1. **Is the full skill already installed?**
   Check whether the skill at this location still has a `das:` block:
   - Global: `grep -q "^das:" ~/.agents/skills/marp-slide-quality/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - Project: `grep -q "^das:" .agents/skills/marp-slide-quality/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null && echo "pointer" || echo "installed"`
   - No `das:` block → full skill installed, invoke it and proceed
   - `das:` block present → go to step 2

2. **Detect scope, then install:**

   To detect scope:
   ```bash
   [ -e ~/.agents/skills/marp-slide-quality ] && echo "global" || echo "project"
   ```

   **Global** (installed with `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add nibzard/marp-slide-quality --skill marp-slide-quality -g -y
   ```

   **Project** (installed without `-g`):
   ```bash
   npx skills add nibzard/marp-slide-quality --skill marp-slide-quality -y
   ```
   > **Claude Code:** prefix either command with `!` to run directly in the prompt.


## Invoke after install

Skill name: `marp-slide-quality`, triggers: "marp slide quality", "SlideGauge", "marp-slide-quality", "nibzard marp"

## What it does

Runs SlideGauge quality analysis on Marp Markdown presentations before they are rendered, catching problems that only appear visually at render time. Detects content overflow (text spilling past slide boundaries), insufficient color contrast, excessive text density, missing structure elements, and layout anti-patterns. Produces a scored report with specific fix recommendations. Best used as a post-creation review pass after marp-slides generates the initial deck.

## When NOT to use

- Reveal.js or Slidev presentations — SlideGauge is Marp-specific
- Creating slides from scratch — use marp-slides first, then run this for quality review
- When you need Marp rendered output — this analyzes the Markdown source, not the render
